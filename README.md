## Work Experiences
### Industrial Attachment (June 2024)
**DBL Ceramics Ltd., Sreepur Upazila, Dhaka**  
As part of a mandatory BUET sessional course, I completed an industrial attachment at DBL Ceramics Ltd., where I gained hands-on exposure to tile manufacturing processes, material characterization, raw material sourcing, and quality control. I also developed practical skills in process optimization, industrial safety, sorting & packaging, and time management while observing large-scale production workflows.

### 2. Capstone Project of 3-2: Arsenic Removal from Ground Water by Adsorption and Photocatalytic Oxidation Method Using MgFe₂O₄-TiO₂ Porous Ceramic

<summary>Open full description</summary>

**Why did we choose adsorption-based method?**  
As (V) can be removed from water through various techniques such as coagulation and ion exchange processes. However, most of these methods are rather expensive for large-scale water treatment systems in remote and underdeveloped areas. Arsenic removal by adsorption has attracted enormous attention due to its easy operation, low cost, and little interference with water. Previous studies have shown that MgFe₂O₄ possesses excellent adsorption of arsenic because it is capable of forming special complexes with As (V), allowing As (V) to be efficiently adsorbed onto the surface of MgFe₂O₄. Furthermore, MgFe₂O₄ could be incorporated onto the surface of TiO₂ lattice, due to the same Pauli radius with TiO₂.

**Background:**  
There are two main forms of arsenic in water: trivalent [As (III)] and pentavalent [As (V)]. Usually, As (III) is prevalent in anoxic conditions such as in groundwater and is in uncharged form in nature, whereas As (V) is thermodynamically stable in surface water. As (III) is reported to have a low adsorption performance to various adsorbents compared with that of As (V) while the toxicity of As (III) is about 25–60 times higher than that of As (V). So, a pretreatment for As (III) to the less toxic As (V) is usually required for adsorption processes. Many oxidants have been applied for oxidation of As (III) to As (V) including O₃, H₂O₂, MnO₂ and TiO₂/UV. The TiO₂/UV system was an effective and low-cost approach.  

Therefore, our MgFe₂O₄–TiO₂/UV system porous ceramic is designed to possess synergistic effect:  
1. TiO₂ oxidizes toxic As (III) to less toxic As (V) - Photocatalytic Oxidation  
2. Then MgFe₂O₄ adsorbs As (V)
